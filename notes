* Use of a sendBase to track the sequence number of the oldest unacknowledged byte.
 (SendBase-1) is the seq num of the last byte ACKed

* Single retransmission timer on packets !
   - if it times out retransmit packet of not-yet-acked smallest seq num, reset timer
   - if receive an ACK, if theres still any unacked segs , reset timer
   - writing and sending data, if there isn't any active timer, start it



-> Cases : Premature timeout (receiver handle it)
   duplicate pakcet may be sent that can be ignored due to higher ACK number (cummulative ACK involved)
   just resend current ACK number
   check seqNum + len(data) is less than your receiverBase and ignore, otherwise process
   send back new ACK num (or use current)

-> Fast retransmit : 3 duplicate ACKs from receiver (sender handle it)
   resend the previous packet


Sender just sending packets like crazy , in window size (all stuffs must be ACK'ed before window can move on)

Reciver has to buffer any out-of-order packets and write them in order
eg. 

Buffer   --- first in window was dropped but already received others 
             (would have triggered fast retransmit by then)

---------------------
| X | V | V | V | V |
---------------------
| V | V | V | V | V |
---------------------

When the receiver receives a sequence number larger than expected (its out of order) or gap detected

writeToFile has to check and see if any packets match (expected Sequence), if there is
remove from buffer -> write data -> incremenet expectedSequence and repeat



Receiver : 

Does it in 1 loop

- Recv.  

if duplicate discard it
if data throw into buffer (so that even if its out of order it doesn't get written immediately)

inspect the buffer for correct seq. packet , write to file if theres any
whenever you write you can raise the ACK value along as well 

otherwise move on to replies

  control packets reply 

  data 
  -> if in order then do normal
  -> if out of order just resend the previous ACK value 


Receiver 3 components -> Receive and chuck into buffer, Inspect buffer and do writes, Send replies
